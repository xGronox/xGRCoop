# ⚠️ Project Status: Discontinued

## What Happened?
You probably saw this mod on NexusMods and noticed how it was **blocked twice**. Here's the full story:

### 🚫 First Ban
**Account:** [xGronox](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xGronox)  
**Reason:** Mentioning the use of a pirated version of the game

### 🚫 Second Ban  
**Account:** [xGRCorp](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xGRCorp)  
**Reason:** Creating an alternative account to evade the ban

---
## 💔 The End of Development
I thought I could create a second account where I wouldn't mention that the mod works with the pirated version, but unfortunately, just a couple of hours after publishing the mod and making big plans including:
- 🎮 Xbox multiplayer
- 👥 Displaying nicknames through Xbox co-op
- 🐛 Fixing bugs reported by users on NexusMods
The mod was blocked again.

**Fun fact:** While I was working on creating multiplayer through the Xbox version of Hollow Knight Silksong, I would periodically check the mod on NexusMods for comments about bugs or new ideas. When I refreshed the page to check my mod - it was already blocked and I received the second ban.

## 🏁 Final Words
**I no longer have the desire or strength to:**
- Continue developing the mod
- Fight with NexusMods staff
- Deal with mod promotion
The NexusMods administration policy has made it clear that I don't even want to submit an appeal anymore.
